Ruby module for translating text from English to lolspeak.

This code is a shameless translation of the Perl CPAN module Acme::LOLCAT.

I decided to translate the Perl module because the venerable lolspeak gem
had gained quite alot of bitrot on ruby 1.9 (UTF-8 v ASCII problems).

Usage:

  require 'moar-lolspeak'
  puts Moar::Lolspeak.translate('Hello, can I please have a cheezeburger?')
